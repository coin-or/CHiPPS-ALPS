**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Alps package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "COIN-Alps", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Alps/trunk Coin-Alps

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Alps and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip Alps_2006Jun07.tgz
   tar xvf Alps_2006Jun07.tar

   (Here "2006Jun07" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
Coin-Alps or Alps_2006Jun07).  Then you type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Alps Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Alps

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Alps successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   Alps/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-examples



==== 8< ======================================================

From here on you find the original installation instructions for the
previous GNU Makefile build system.  Most details have changed, but
for now we keep it here so that possibly missing items might be found
here.

PREREQUISITES FOR INSTALLATION
==============================

NOTE: CoinDir is the path to the directory of COIN
NOTE: AlpsDir is the path to the directory of COIN/Alps

1. Download the necessary components (Alps, Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl) of COIN
   - Alps depends on Coin.
   - Example CoinDir/Examples/Knap depends on Coin
   - Example CoinDir/Examples/Abc depends on Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl
   - AlpsDir/Bcps (to be released) depends on Coin
   - AlpsDir/Bcps/Blis (to be released) depends on Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl
2. At the moment, on (*)nix platforms, you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
3. must use gnu make
4. To make the documentation, doxygen must be installed


TO CREATE HTML DOCUMENTATION
============================

In AlpsDir, 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes 
in the library. By default, the created html documentation is in
AlpsDir/Doc/html.


TO BUILD ALPS SERIAL LIBRARY AND RUN EXAMPLES
=============================================

1. Read and edit the top of AlpsDir/Makefile.config:
   - select to build serial library by 
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = NONE' if it is commented
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = MPICH' if it is not
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = LAMMPI' if it is not
   - select whether to build shared or static library
   - select optimization level

2. In AlpsDir, 'make' to build and install the Alps serial library.

3. Build and run examples. Please refer to the INSTALL files in 
   CoinDir/Examples/Knap or CoinDir/Examples/Abc.


TO BUILD ALPS PARALLEL LIBRARY AND RUN EXAMPLES
===============================================

1. Read and edit the top of Makefile.config:
   - select to build parallel library by 
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = NONE' if it is not
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = MPICH' if using MPICH
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = LAMMPI' if using LAMMPI
   - select optimization level

2. In AlpsDir, 'make' to build and install the Alps parallel library.

3. Build and run examples. Please refer to the INSTALL files in 
   CoinDir/Examples/Knap or CoinDir/Examples/Abc.
