/** Interface between Abc and Cut Generation Library.
   
    \c AbcCutGenerator is intended to provide an intelligent interface between
    Abc and the cutting plane algorithms in the CGL. A \c AbcCutGenerator is
    bound to a \c CglCutGenerator and to an \c AbcModel. It contains parameters
    which control when and how the \c generateCuts method of the
    \c CglCutGenerator will be called.

    The builtin decision criteria available to use when deciding whether to
    generate cuts are limited: every <i>X</i> nodes, when a solution is found,
    and when a subproblem is found to be infeasible. The idea is that the class
    will grow more intelligent with time.
    
    \todo Add a pointer to function member which will allow a client to install
        their own decision algorithm to decide whether or not to call the CGL
        \p generateCuts method. Create a default decision method that looks
	at the builtin criteria.
  
    \todo It strikes me as not good that generateCuts contains code specific to
	individual CGL algorithms. Another set of pointer to function members,
	so that the client can specify the cut generation method as well as
	pre- and post-generation methods? Taken a bit further, should this
	class contain a bunch of pointer to function members, one for each
	of the places where the cut generator might be referenced?
	Initialization, root node, search tree node, discovery of solution,
	and termination all come to mind. Initialization and termination would
	also be useful for instrumenting sbb.
