  LongName: Abstract Library for Parallel Search.
  ShortDescription: A collection of abstract base classes for implementing parallel tree search.
  LongDescription: |2
    CHiPPS is the COIN-OR Open Parallel Search Framework, a framework for
    implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. The current CHiPPS
    architecture consists of three layers (ALPS, BiCEPS, BLIS). The Abstract
    Library for Parallel Search (ALPS) is the base layer of a hierarchy
    consisting of implementations of various tree search algorithms for
    specific problem types.
