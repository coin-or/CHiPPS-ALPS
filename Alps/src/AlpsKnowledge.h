  The abstract base class of Alps knowledges generated during the search. It is

  It provides the API for encoding and decoding functions. ::encode/::decode
  functions implemented here will work on simple classes (stored in contigious
  memory), that does not have pointers or STL containers. Complicated classes
  are required to implement their versions of encode/decode functions.
