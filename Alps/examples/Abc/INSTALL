TO BUILD AND RUN SERIAL ABC (UNIX-LIKE ENVIRONMENTS)
====================================================

1. Download and build ALPS-1.0 serial library. Please refer to the INSTALL
file in the installation directory.

2. In BUILDDIR/Alps/examples/Abc, type 'make' to build the executable.

3. Modify parameters if desired. ALPS-1.0/Alps/include/AlpsParams.h has
explanations of each parameter. There are two ways to specify parameters:
   - parameter file: abc.par
   - command line

The user must specify:
   - which instance to solve

The users can specify:
   - maximum solution time
   - log level, etc.

4. To run Abc, type 

	BUILDDIR/Bcps/examples/Abc/abc -param abc.par

   Abc can also read in parameters from command line, for instance

	BUILDDIR/Bcps/examples/Abc/abc -Alps_instance ../../Data/Sample/p0033.mps
	

TO BUILD AND RUN PARALLEL ABC (UNIX_LIKE ENVIRONMENTS)
======================================================

1. Download and build ALPS-1.0 serial library. Please refer to the INSTALL
file in the installation directory.

2. In BUILDDIR/Alps/examples/Abc, type 'make' to build the executable.

3. Modify parameters if desired. AlpsDir/include/AlpsParams.h has explanations
of each parameter. There are two ways to specify parameters:
   - parameter file: AbcDir/abc.par
   - command line

The user must specify:
   - which instance to solve
   - how many processes to be launched 

The user can specify:
   - how many hubs
   - maximum solution time
   - log level, etc.

4. The way to run the parallel version depends on users' computing
environment, but in general the command line should look something like

    mpirun -np numProcesses BUILDDIR/Alps/examples/Abc/abc -param abc.par
