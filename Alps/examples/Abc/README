WHAT IS ABC
============

Abc is an example of the applications developed on top of Alps (See 
the README of Alps). Abc is a simple branch and cut solver for Mixed
Integer Linear Programming. Its whole purpose is to illustrate how to write 
an application based on Alps. Blis (to be released soon) is a serious
mixed integer linear Programming (MILP) solver, which can be used to 
solve MILPs.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in Alps (See INSTALL of Alps) can be 
created. A user's guide that is under preparation that can help users to 
develop an application.


INSTALLATION
============

Please see the INSTALL file for a guide to install Abc.
