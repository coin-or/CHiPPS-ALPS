WHAT IS ALPS
============

Alps is a framework for implementing parallel graph search algorithms. 
It generalizes many of the notions present in BCP, allowing the implementation
of a wider range of algorithms with a simplified interface. Alps implements
the search handling methods required for implementing large-scale,
data-intensive parallel search algorithms, such as those used for 
solving discrete optimization problems. It is the base layer of a 
planned hierarchy that will include a library for solving mixed-integer
linear programs.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in Alps (See INSTALL) can be created
readily. A user's guide that is under preparation can show users how to 
develop an application based Alps and how to use existing applications.


INSTALLATION
============

Please see the INSTALL file for a guide to install Alps.
