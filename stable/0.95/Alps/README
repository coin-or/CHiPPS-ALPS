WHAT IS ALPS
============

Alps is a framework for implementing parallel graph search algorithms. Its
methodology generalizes many of the notions of an LP-based branch-and-bound
algorithm, allowing the implementation of a wide range of algorithms with a
simplified interface. Alps implements the search handling methods required for
implementing large-scale, data-intensive parallel search algorithms, such as
those used for solving discrete optimization problems. It is the base layer of
the Cops (COIN Open Parallel Search Framework) library hierarchy that will
includes a library for solving mixed integer linear programs (Blis).

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in Alps (See INSTALL) can be created
readily. A user's guide that is under preparation can show users how to 
develop an application based Alps and how to use existing applications.

INSTALLATION
============

Please see the INSTALL file for a guide to install Alps.
